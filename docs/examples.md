# Examples

The following sections illustrate some typical checks you could perform.

## Class dependencies

#### Layered Architecture

</p>

If you are organizing your code in layers (e.g. with an onion structure), you might want to ensure that
the inner layers do not depend on the outer ones:

>Classes in namespace App\Domain should not depend on classes in namespace App\Application and classes in namespace App\Infrastructure

>Classes in namespace App\Application should not depend on classes in namespace App\Infrastructure

<h2></h2>

#### Model-View-Controller

</p>

If you are using a MVC approach, you could ensure that both model and view are not coupled to controllers. You also might want to check that they are not coupled to each other:

>Classes in namespace App\Model and classes in namespace App\View should not depend on classes in namespace App\Controller

>Classes in namespace App\Model should not depend on classes in namespace App\View

>Classesin namespace App\View should not depend on classes in namespace App\Model

#### Vendors coupling

>Classes in namespace App\Domain can only depend on classes in namespace App\Domain

<h2></h2>

#### Aggregates

<p align="center">
    <img width="500px" src="assets/aggregates.png" alt="Aggregates">
</p>

You won't want your classes to have direct access to the members of an aggregate, except for the aggregate root.
You can use a lot of different approaches to identify the root and its members: by namespace, filepath, an abstract or interface for the aggregate root, etc.
If you have, for instance, an AggregateRootInterface you can create a rule like this

>Classes in namespace App excluding classes that implement App\Domain\Entity\AggregateRootInterface should not depend on
>classes in namespace App\Domain\Entity excluding classes that implement App\Domain\Entity\AggregateRootInterface

<br />

## Inheritance

#### Enforcing or forbidding an abstract extension

<p align="center">
    <img width="500px" src="assets/abstract.png" alt="Abstract">
</p>

You might want to ensure that a specific type of classes are extending a certain abstract class. Services, Controllers, CommandHandlers, etc.

>Classes with name `/^App\\Application\\.+Handler$/` should extend class with name App\Application\AbstractHandler

<h2></h2>

<br />

## Composition

#### Enforcing or forbidding an interface implementation

<p align="center">
    <img width="500px" src="assets/interface.png" alt="Interface">
</p>

You might want to ensure that a specific type of classes are implementing a certain interface. ValueObjects, Entities, etc.

>Classes in namespace App\Domain\Entity should implement class with name App\Domain\Entity\EntityInterface

<h2></h2>
