# Contributing

There are several ways to help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/carlosas/phpat/issues/) on GitHub if you have found a bug or have an idea for a feature
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues

## Pull Requests

* Meaningful modifications, for typos or superfluous changes open an issue
* All features should be covered by tests if possible
* All tests and coding standard checks should pass

```bash
composer validate --strict
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config ./ci/php-cs-fixer.php
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c ci/phpstan.neon
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c ci/phpstan-phpat.neon
vendor/bin/psalm -c ci/psalm.xml
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/
```

## Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs` folder.

The documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
To build the documentation locally, run:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm -v$(pwd):/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material:9
```
When the container is running, you can access the documentation at http://localhost:8000.
When the pull request is merged, the documentation will be automatically deployed to https://phpat.carlosas.me.
