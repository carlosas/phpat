# Assertions

Assertion is the type of verification that can be done in the selected classes.

## shouldBeNamed()
It asserts that the selected classes are **named** as specified.

## shouldBeFinal()
It asserts that the selected classes are declared as **final**.

Also available: `shouldNotBeFinal()`

## shouldBeAbstract()
It asserts that the selected classes are declared as **abstract**.

Also available: `shouldNotBeAbstract()`

## shouldBeInterface()
It asserts that the selected classes are **interfaces**.

## shouldBeReadonly()
It asserts that the selected classes are declared as **readonly**.

Also available: `shouldNotBeReadonly()`

## shouldHaveOnlyOnePublicMethod()
It asserts that the selected classes only have **one public method** (besides constructor).

## shouldExtend()
It asserts that the selected classes **extend** the target class.

Also available: `shouldNotExtend()`

## shouldImplement()
It asserts that the selected classes **implement** the target interfaces.

Also available: `shouldNotImplement()`

## shouldInclude()
It asserts that the selected classes **include** the target traits.

Also available: `shouldNotInclude()`

## shouldNotDependOn()
It asserts that the selected classes **do not depend** on the target classes.

## shouldNotConstruct()
It asserts that the selected classes **do not use the constructor** of the target classes.

## shouldApplyAttribute()
It asserts that the selected classes **apply** the target attributes.

## canOnlyDependOn()
It asserts that the selected classes **do not depend** on anything else than the target classes.

This would be equivalent to `shouldNotDependOn()` with the negation of the target classes.
